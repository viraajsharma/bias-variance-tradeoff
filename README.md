# Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff: Theory and Experiments

This repository contains the code, experiments, and paper draft for a research project on the **Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff**.  
We explore the tradeoff theoretically and empirically using both **synthetic** and **real-world datasets**, and study techniques like **regularization** (L1, L2, dropout, early stopping) to mitigate overfitting and underfitting.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
- Theoretical explanation of biasâ€“variance decomposition.
- Controlled experiments on synthetic datasets.
- Application to real-world datasets.
- Evaluate regularization methods to balance bias & variance.
- Professional paper-style report.

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
- `src/` â†’ Core implementations (models, data, utils).
- `experiments/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for experiments.
- `results/` â†’ Plots and metrics from experiments.
- `docs/` â†’ Paper draft, notes, references.
