# bias-variance-tradeoff
This repository contains the code, experiments, and paper draft for a research project on the **Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff**.   We explore the tradeoff theoretically and empirically using both **synthetic** and **real-world datasets**, and study techniques like **regularization** (L1, L2) to mitigate overfitting and underfitting.
